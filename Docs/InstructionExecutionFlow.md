## Instruction execution flow ##

The following is the chain of operations performed by [IZ80Processor](../Main/IZ80Processor.cs) when executing one instruction, either as part of the instructions execution loop or when executing one single instruction (see [how execution works](HowExecutionWorks.md)).

1. The `BeforeInstructionFetch` event is triggered. _The code that handles the event has an opportunity to request execution termination by invoking `BeforeInstructionFetchEventArgs.ExecutionStopper.Stop`_.
2. The first opcode byte of the instruction to be executed is retrieved by reading `Memory[Registers.PC]`.
3. The `InstructionExecutor.Execute` method is invoked.

The code for `InstructionExecutor.Execute` does then the following:

4. The `ProcessorAgent.FetchNextOpcode` method is invoked, if necessary, in order to retrieve additional opcde bytes for the instruction.
5. The `InstructionExecutor.InstructionFetchFinished` event is fired. _This causes `IZ80Processor` to fire the `BeforeInstructionExecution` event_.
6. The instruction is processed, using the members of `ProcessorAgent` as appropriate to access registers, memory and ports. _Execution termination can be requested at this point by invoking `ProcessorAgent.Stop` (the default implementation of `IZ80InstructionExecutor` does never do this)_. 
7. The method terminates, returning the count of T states required to execute the instruction.

Control returns then to `IZ80Processor`:

8. The `AfterInstructionExecution` event is triggered. _The code that handles the event has an opportunity to request execution termination by invoking `AfterInstructionExecutionEventArgs.ExecutionStopper.Stop`_.
9. `IClockSynchronizer.TryWait` is executed, having the value returned by `InstructionExecutor.Execute` plus any additional extra wait states passed as the T states count.
10. `TStatesElapsedSinceStart` and `TStatesElapsedSinceReset` are increased by the same value calculated in the previous step.
11. If one of [the execution stop conditions](StopConditions.md) is met, [the method that initiated the execution](HowExecutionWorks.md) returns.
12. If inside an instruction execution loop, the flow starts again for the next instruction.

Note that [BeforeInstructionFetchEventArgs](../Main/EventArgs/BeforeInstructionFetchEventArgs.cs), [BeforeInstructionExecutionEventArgs](../Main/EventArgs/BeforeInstructionExecutionEventArgs.cs) and [AfterInstructionExecutionEventArgs](../Main/EventArgs/AfterInstructionExecutionEventArgs.cs) inherit from [ProcessorEventArgs](../Main/EventArgs/ProcessorEventArgs.cs), which defines the `LocalUserState` property. This property is propagated from the 'before fetch' event to the 'before execution' event and from this one to the 'after execution' event, and can be used by the events handling code at its convenience.
